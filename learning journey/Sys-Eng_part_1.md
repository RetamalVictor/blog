# Practice Project for Systems Engineering - Part 1

Imagine you’re at your local RC club race. Your RC buggy rockets down the straight and **snap**, the radio link dies.  
No brakes, no hope. Or you’re threading hair-pins, but the video feed lags so badly you might as well be driving blindfolded.

That nightmare is the frustration this project sets out to erase.
>*“I want my WLtoys buggy to brake by itself if the radio dies,and I want live video that isn’t a slideshow—all for pocket money.”*

This post captures the **front-end thinking**, mission framing, requirements, trade studies, and a first-cut architecture, *before a single line of firmware is written*. 

> DISCLAIMER: I haven't done extensive testing for the hardware pieces included in the project. Since this is an exercise, I "trusted" GPT o3 with the estimates for the latencies and such. If I were planning to carry on with this project, a whole verification and validation process would need to be done for those parts.

## 1  Where This Is Headed  

> **Why this section exists** We open with a crystal-clear finish line. Numbers first; the figures anchor every future argument.

**TARGET PERFORMANCE** 

* Braking 30 km h⁻¹ → 0 in ≤ 1.2 m  
* 30 fps FPV with ≤ 120 ms glass-to-glass latency  
  *Primary feed = analogue 5.8 GHz (6-8 ms); secondary = MJPEG Wi-Fi (bench)*  
* Slam-stop on radio loss in < 100 ms  

These numbers are the compass. They are deliberately “edge-case hard” so that normal operation feels effortless.  
Whenever we debate a design choice, we drag it back to this bullet list and ask: *does it move the needle or just add weight?*

## 2  From Idea to Mission Definition

Before solder smoke and Git commits, systems engineering forces us to tame the foggy idea.  
We interrogate the concept with three questions: **who hurts, how do they hurt, what single outcome removes the pain?**

| SE Step                  | Key Question  | Draft Answer                                               |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stakeholder analysis** | Who benefits?| Club racers, track marshals, future devs.                  |
| **Need extraction**      | What hurts?  | Long braking, risk of runaway, laggy or dropped FPV.       |
| **Mission wording**      | Outcome?     | “Stop safely and stream low-latency video with hobby parts.”|

The table may look trivial, but it took three sticky-note sessions to collapse sprawling wish-lists into defined mission points with a  **single declarative sentence**.

1.  **Mission M.1 — Braking Safety**  
*Bring the buggy from 30 km h⁻¹ to a full stop in ≤ 1.2 m, or within 100 ms of radio loss, without wheel lock-up.*  

2. **Mission M.2 — Low-Latency Situational Awareness**  
*Provide a forward-facing FPV stream with ≤ 120 ms glass-to-glass latency, using hobby-grade parts and keeping the extra electronics under $ 60.*  

Those two missions become the filters for every requirement that follows.

## 2½  The V-Model - Why Every Box Has a Mirror Test  

Most hobby builds stumble because tests are bolted on last.  
The **V-model** forces us to architect *and* pre-plan proof in one sweep: decompose on the left, verify on the right.

```

Stakeholder Needs  →  System Req  →  High-Level Design  →  Detailed Design  →  Code
↑                                                                              ↓
│                           Integration & Verification                         │
└──────────────────  Subsystem / Component Tests  ←  Unit Tests  ←  Build  ←───┘

```

*Left side* → we slide **downwards**, refining fuzzy pains (long braking, laggy FPV) into the SMART “shall” statements you’ll meet in Section 3, then into the architecture snapshot of Section 5.  
*Right side* → we climb **upwards**, using the Verification Matrix (Section 7) to prove—unit by unit, then subsystem by subsystem—that the real buggy matches those early promises. 

| V-Step                   | This-post Artefact                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Stakeholder Needs        | Section 2 table                           |
| System Requirements      | SMART table (Sec. 3)                      |
| High-Level Design        | Functional/physical map (Sec. 5)          |
| Detailed Design / Code   | **Part 2**                                |
| Unit & Component Tests   | Logic-analyser script, latency rig        |
| System Verification      | Brake-distance hallway test               |
| Validation (real value?) | Hopefully someday a cool video            |

Reading down the left-hand leg you feel abstraction thinning; reading up the right, you see confidence thickening.  
That symmetry is the mental model you’ll spot in every later decision.

## 3  SMART Requirements - Yardsticks We’ll Build To  

> **How this table was born** We ran a ruthless word-workout: every “should” became a “shall”, every vague adjective gained a number, every number gained a **kitchen-table test**.

| ID   | “Shall” Statement (measurable)                                            | Planned Verification            |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **FR-1a** | Detect Rx PWM loss > 120 ms | Logic-analyser script.          |
| **FR-1b** | Drive the ESC to a ≥ 100 % brake pulse within ≤ 100 ms of FR-1a firing. | Logic-analyser + scope.          |
| **FR-2** | Rear-wheel ABS reduces 30 km h⁻¹ stop distance to **≤ 1.2 m**.        | Tape-measure & high-speed cam.  |
| **FR-3** | Analogue FPV latency **≤ 20 ms** (95 %-ile).                          | IR-LED scope rig.               |
| **FR-4** | MJPEG Wi-Fi stream ≥ 30 fps, latency **≤ 120 ms**.                    | LED-flash latency rig.          |
| **FR-5** | Log IMU, wheel speed, PWM at 100 Hz to SD-card.                       | CSV inspection.                 |
| **CO-1** | Prototype electronics **≤ \$60**.                                     | Excel BOM.                      |

Note the twin latency requirements: **FR-3** guards the race-day analogue link, **FR-4** covers the bench-friendly Wi-Fi feed.  
Cost (CO-1) sits beside functional goals, because clever design that busts the budget still fails the mission.

## 4  Trade-Space Exploration - Survival of the Smartest  

> **Mental model:** widen the funnel first, then hack it down with constraints from Sec. 3 until one option per row survives.

| Topic             | Options Considered                                     | Decision                                | Key Rationale                                       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Control link**  | Wi-Fi, BLE, 2.4 GHz FHSS                               | **ELRS 2.4 GHz Rx/Tx + HW PWM-mux**            | Lower packet loss, hardware failsafe reverts to radio if MCU dies                 |
| **FPV transport** | Analogue 5.8 GHz, MJPEG Wi-Fi, H-264 Wi-Fi, digital HD | **Hybrid:** WildFire Nano + ESP32 MJPEG | Analogue nails latency/range; Wi-Fi is bench-easy.  |
| **ABS sensing**   | 4-wheel quadrature, 1-wheel Hall, IMU-only             | **1 Hall + IMU**                        | Adequate accuracy, low weight & cost.               |
| **Compute board** | Custom PCB, STM32, **ESP32-S3-CAM dev-kit**            | **ESP32-S3-CAM**                        | Built-in cam & Wi-Fi, \$10, community tooling.      |

The exercise isn’t about “best tech”, it’s about *best fit* against the SMART grid.  
Notice how latency and cost killed several shinier options.

## 5  Architecture Snapshot  

<figure style="text-align:center;">
  <!-- system-level signal-flow diagram -->
  <img src="../assets/images/learning/sys_architecture.png"
       alt="System signal-flow: user Tx to Rx, sensing, estimation, control, actuation, and twin telemetry paths"
       style="max-width:100%;height:auto;display:block;margin:0 auto;">
  <figcaption style="font-style:italic;">
    End-to-end signal map for the System.  
    The solid spine (Sensing → Estimation → Control → Actuation) closes the brake loop;  
    side trunks carry <strong>Wi-Fi telemetry</strong> for logs and a <strong>5.8 GHz analogue feed</strong> for race-grade FPV.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

Reading the diagram:
  1. User Tx → 2.4 GHz Rx The hand-held transmitter delivers throttle/brake PWM. The 74HC157 mux defaults to this lane if the ESP32 watchdog stops toggling.
  If that link goes silent for more than 120 ms, FR-1a’s failsafe slams the brakes.
  2. Sensing ingests both vehicle data (wheel Hall count, IMU) and the human command from the Rx, time-stamping everything at 100 Hz.
  3. Estimation fuses sensor cues, computes slip, and forwards a clean state vector to Control.
  4. Control blends the user’s throttle intent with ABS logic and watchdogs; the output is a shaped PWM duty that Actuation feeds to the ESC via the mux’s second lane.
  5. In parallel, Telemetry pushes logs over Wi-Fi, and the dedicated FPV chain beams low-latency analogue video to the driver’s goggles.

Picture each arrow as a contract: data-rate, latency, and verification hook are already pencilled in. Anything that can’t find a home here loops back to Trade-Space for a rethink.

## 6  Sub-System Focus - FPV & Telemetry  

Ideally, the latency budgets will require extensive exploration and expertise, followed by thouroug verification. However, since this is a starting point exercise, I'm going to trust the search of gpt o3 for this values. If I were to implement this at some point, a huge chunk of time will go into verifying all the LLM claims. 


### Analogue (primary)

| Hop                   | Target ms | Comment                |
|-----------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Cam exposure → RF mod | 3         | CMOS NTSC sensor.      |
| Air link              | 4 – 6     | 25 mW, clear LOS.      |
| RF demod → LCD        | 6 – 8     | Typical goggles.       |
| **Total**             | **< 20**  | Meets FR-3 comfortably |

### Wi-Fi (secondary)

| Hop             | Target ms | Comment                         |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| Sensor → JPEG   | 20        | ESP32 HW encoder.               |
| JPEG → Wi-Fi    | 5         | Memory-to-PHY DMA.              |
| Air link        | 50 – 80   | 2.4 GHz crowd-dependent.        |
| Decode → LCD    | 15        | Browser GPU.                    |
| **Total**       | **75-120**| Meets FR-4 given RF hygiene.    |

Take-away: the system tolerates Wi-Fi jitter because the *race-critical* feed is analogue.

## 7  Verification Matrix  

> **Reading tip:** scan a row, mentally imagine the bench rig that proves it, feel the risk evaporate.

| Req  | Tool             | Pass Criterion     |
|------|------------------|--------------------|
| FR-1a | Logic-analyser   | ≤ 120 ms gap          |
| FR-1b | Logic-analyser   | ≤ 100 ms to 1.30 ms pulse           |
| FR-2 | High-speed video | ≤ 1.2 m            |
| FR-3 | IR scope rig     | ≤ 20 ms (95 %)     |
| FR-4 | LED latency rig  | ≤ 120 ms           |
| FR-5 | pandas log check | No missing samples |
| CO-1 | Excel BOM        | ≤ \$60             |

Spend ten minutes sketching each rig now; save ten days of “why is it slow?” later.

### Ready for the Right-Hand Side?

Everything above cements the *why* and the *what* of this project.
But diagrams don’t stop runaway cars—firmware, task graphs, and PCB traces do.
In **Part 2** we pivot from “paper promises” to “design you can compile”

If Part 1 gave you the mental scaffolding, Part 2 will hand you the wrench set.
**Grab a coffee and jump in → *Practice Project for Systems Engineering - Part 2***.
