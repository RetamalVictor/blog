# Content descriptions
content:
  about_description: |
    I'm a Machine Learning Research Engineer specializing in computer vision, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent systems.
    I build production ML systems that enable intelligent behavior in autonomous robots, from UAVs and ground vehicles
    to distributed swarm systems operating in complex real-world environments.

  about_extended: |
    I develop and deploy deep learning architectures for robotic perception and control, with real-world applications
    in visual SLAM, learned navigation policies, and multi-agent coordination. My work combines cutting-edge ML research
    with practical robotics applications, bridging the gap between state-of-the-art algorithms and physical systems.
