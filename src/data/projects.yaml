    title: "PX4 State Sharing: Distributed Multi-UAV Formation Control"
    description: "Peer-to-peer state sharing module for PX4 enabling decentralized UAV coordination through direct MAVLink communication."

    longDescription: |
      This project implements a distributed formation control system for multiple UAVs using PX4's state-sharing module, eliminating the need for centralized control. The system operates through three key phases: initialization (state broadcasting activation), discovery (neighbor position reception via MAVLink), and coordination (formation velocity calculation using relative positioning).

      The architecture features a communication stack that broadcasts vehicle telemetry using MAVLink protocol with broadcast/multicast networking, micro-DDS bridge for ROS2 topic translation, and distributed neighbor detection mechanisms. Demonstrated with three PX4-based quadrotors maintaining structured flight patterns through purely peer-to-peer coordination. Currently under review in PX4 pull request #25884, representing active contribution to the upstream autopilot project.

    title: "MAPF-GNN: Multi-Robot Pathfinding with Graph Neural Networks"
    description: "Decentralized multi-agent path planning using Graph Convolutional Networks for independent navigation with local observations."

    longDescription: |
      Graph Neural Network-based implementation for decentralized multi-robot path planning on grid environments. Agents operate independently without centralized coordination, using GNNs to make navigation decisions based solely on local observations of their surroundings.

      The system features Graph Convolutional Networks with spectral filters for message passing between agents, Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithms for generating optimal training data, and a custom Gymnasium-compatible multi-agent grid environment. Includes comprehensive benchmarking suite for performance profiling, real-time visualization tools, and 44 unit tests covering algorithm correctness and scalability.

      Implements research from "Graph Neural Networks for Decentralized Multi-Robot Path Planning" (Li et al.), demonstrating how neural policies can enable scalable decentralized coordination in obstacle-filled environments. Academic project developed for ML with Graphs course at VU Amsterdam.
