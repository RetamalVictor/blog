    longDescription: |
      This project implements a distributed formation control system for multiple UAVs using PX4's state-sharing module, eliminating the need for centralized control. The system operates through three key phases: initialization (state broadcasting activation), discovery (neighbor position reception via MAVLink), and coordination (formation velocity calculation using relative positioning).

      The architecture features a communication stack that broadcasts vehicle telemetry using MAVLink protocol with broadcast/multicast networking, micro-DDS bridge for ROS2 topic translation, and distributed neighbor detection mechanisms. Demonstrated with three PX4-based quadrotors maintaining structured flight patterns through purely peer-to-peer coordination. Currently under review in PX4 pull request #25884, representing active contribution to the upstream autopilot project.
